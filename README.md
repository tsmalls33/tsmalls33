# Hi, I'm Thomas 👋

I'm a software developer with a background as a professional basketball player. Now, I'm channeling that same discipline and focus into writing clean, maintainable code and building real-world applications.

I'm currently developing a real estate management platform under the mentorship of a senior engineer. I’m committed to building a solid foundation in both backend and full-stack development — no shortcuts.

I'm actively looking for a **remote or hybrid entry-level role or internship in Barcelona** (or remote-friendly companies based in Europe).
