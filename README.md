<h1>👋 Hi, I’m Thomas Smallwood.</h1>

I have been a professional basketball player in Europe since August 2019. 
I am currently learning software and web development in my free time on a daily basis. 
My goal is to start developing my portfolio and start working remotely in this field while I am still playing basketball. 
I’d be glad to collaborate on any kind of project that would further my education as a software/web developer.

<h2>📜 My degrees:</h2>

  - BA in Communication studies (University of Alabama at Birmingham)
  - Master in Public Administration (University of Tennessee at Chattanooga)
