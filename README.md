<h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Thomas Smallwood.</h1>

Iâ€™m a professional basketball player in Europe since 2019, now deeply committed to building a career in software and web development. Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve been learning and coding dailyâ€”working through real-world projects and collaborating with mentors.

My focus is on backend and full-stack development, currently using technologies like Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, NestJS, and FastAPI. Iâ€™m especially interested in clean architecture, data modeling, and building tools that solve real problems.

Iâ€™m always open to collaborating on projects that push me to learn and grow as a developer. Feel free to reach out if youâ€™re working on something interesting.
