<h1>👋 Hi, I’m Thomas Smallwood.</h1>

I have been a professional basketball player in Europe since August 2019.
I’m currently learning software development with my free time on a daily basis.
My goal is to start developing my portfolio and ideally start working remote jobs in that field while I am still playing basketball.
I’d be glad to collaborate on any kind of project that would further my education as a software developer.

<h2>📜 My degrees:</h2>

  - BA in Communication studies (University of Alabama at Birmingham)
  - Master in Public Administration (University of Tennessee at Chattanooga)
